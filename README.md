## Image_data_compression.py 
Image compression is just one application of linear algebra, specifically Singular Value Decompositions, SVD. A SVD is a special application of Eigenvalue decompositions, EVD, with relaxed conditions. Under the SVD the term Eigenvalue is replaced with the term Singular Value. This file provides an exploration into image compression by first taking a colour image, converting the image into greyscale, decomposing the greyscale matrix, and finally reconstructing the matrix using only the top K vectors.
